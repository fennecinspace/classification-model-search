# Pytorch Classification Model Search Tool

Do you have a classification dataset and want to know what is the best model to train on it ? You can use this tool to have search for the best classification performance on a specific dataset.

We use a Fire Classification dataset as a use case, Model search is done from this list : 

- VGG16
- VGG19
- MobileNet V1
- MobileNet V2
- MobileNet V3
- DenseNet169
- ResNet50
- ResNet18
- Inception V3
- EfficientNetV2
- Vit
- SqueezNet
